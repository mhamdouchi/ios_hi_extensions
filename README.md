# HI Extensions

The purpose of this repository is to provide reusable components for Swift. These components come in the form of Classes, Extensions, and Protocols.

# Classes  
`ConfettiView`: Provides a confetti effect to be added to your views.

`DynamicTableViewDataSource`: Allows you to pass in cell proxy objects to an instance of this class and load all of the Table View cells in your projects using one common class.

`PaddingButton`: Provides a UIButton subclass with optional padding around the button label title.

`PaddingLabel`: Provides a UILabel subclass with optional padding around the label.

`StrokeLabel`: Provides a UILabel subclass with stroke around the letters. 


# Extensions
`BinaryInteger`: Provides helper methods for even and odd numbers.

`BundleExtension`: Provides helper methods for accessing app `versionNumber` and `buildNumber`

`CGFloatExtension`: Provides a static var for `statusBarHeight`. This is especially helpful when you need to draw a view under the status bar for an iPhone with and without the notch.
